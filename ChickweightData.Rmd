This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
data("ChickWeight")
times <-unique(ChickWeight$Time)
chickcolors <- c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green")

for (i in 1:4) {
for(x in times) {
  ifelse(ChickWeight$Diet==i &
           ChickWeight$Time==x, ChickWeight$average[ChickWeight$Time==x &
            ChickWeight$Diet==i] <- mean(ChickWeight$weight[ChickWeight$Time==x &
            ChickWeight$Diet==i]),NA)
}
}
average1 <-ChickWeight$average[1:12]
average2 <-ChickWeight$average[221:232]
average3 <-ChickWeight$average[341:352]
average4 <-ChickWeight$average[461:472]
average <- list(average1,average2, average3, average4)

plot(ChickWeight$Time, ChickWeight$average, col =ChickWeight$Diet, pch=21, xlab = "Time", ylab ="ChickWeight Average", main = "ChickWeight Average vs Time")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
